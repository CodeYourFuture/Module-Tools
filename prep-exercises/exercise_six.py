#Think of the advantages of using methods instead of free functions. Write them down in your notebook.

# Easy and direct to data and thus more efficient when working on them.
# it's more reusable since all instances of a class inheret those methods defined in it automatically.
# you'll be less prone to make mistakes when using methods as part of a class/isntance of it as opposed to a free function attempting to aceess the class data.
# code is more organised and readable when methods are part of a class as opposed to when they're just free functions.
