#Write a program which:

#1.Already has a list of Laptops that a library has to lend out.
#2.Accepts user input to create a new Person - it should use the input function to read a person’s
#name, age, and preferred operating system.
#3.Tells the user how many laptops the library has that have that operating system.
#4.If there is an operating system that has more laptops available, tells the user that if they’re willing to
#accept that operating system they’re more likely to get a laptop.

#You should convert the age and preferred operating system input from the user into more constrained
#types as quickly as possible, and should output errors to stderr and terminate the program with a non-
#zero exit code if the user input bad values.
