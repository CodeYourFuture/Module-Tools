# --- Exercise ---
# Think of the advantages of using methods instead of free functions. Write them down in your notebook.

# --- Solution ---
# Methods are bundled with the data they operate on, making the code more organised.
# Methods can be reused across different parts of the program.
# Methods make code more readable and easier to understand.
# Changes to the method's implementation only need to be made in one place.
