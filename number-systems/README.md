Do not use any tools or programming to solve these problems. Work it out yourself by hand, and fill in the answers.

Do not convert any binary numbers to decimal when solving a question unless the question explicitly tells you to.

The goal of these exercises is for you to gain an intuition for binary numbers. Using tools to solve the problems defeats the point.

Convert the decimal number 14 to binary.
Answer: Divide by 2 and record the remainders, then write the remainders in reverse order
14 / 2 = 7 R 0
7 / 2 = 3 R 1
3 / 2 = 1 R 1
1 / 2 = 0 R 1

Convert the binary number 101101 to decimal:
Answer:

2^0 x 1 = 1
2^1 x 0 = 0
2^2 x 1 = 4
2^3 x 1 = 8
2^4 x 0 = 0
2^5 x 1 = 32

1 + 0 + 4 + 8 + 0 + 32 = 45

What is 10101 + 01010?
Answer: 
  1 0 1 0 1
+ 0 1 0 1 0

Adding from right to left

1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1

What is 10001 + 10001?
Answer:
  1 0 0 0 1  
+ 1 0 0 0 1  

Adding from right to left

1 + 1 = 10  = 0 carry 1
0 + 0 + carry 1 = 1
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 0 = 0
1 + 1 = 10
