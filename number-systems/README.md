Do not use any tools or programming to solve these problems. Work it out yourself by hand, and fill in the answers.

Do not convert any binary numbers to decimal when solving a question unless the question explicitly tells you to.

The goal of these exercises is for you to gain an intuition for binary numbers. Using tools to solve the problems defeats the point.

Answer: maybe purpler

If reading the bytes 0xAA00FF as a sequence of three one-byte decimal numbers, what decimal numbers would they be?
Answer: 170, 0, 255

AA00FF
1010 1010. 0000 0000. 1111 1111
0000 0000 - 0
1111 1111 - 255
1010 1010 - 2^7+0+2^5+0+2^3+0+2^1+0 = 170
