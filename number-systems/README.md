Do not use any tools or programming to solve these problems. Work it out yourself by hand, and fill in the answers.

Do not convert any binary numbers to decimal when solving a question unless the question explicitly tells you to.

The goal of these exercises is for you to gain an intuition for binary numbers. Using tools to solve the problems defeats the point.

How many bits would you need in order to store the numbers between 0 and 255 inclusive?
Answer: we need 8 bits (11111111(binary) = 255 (decimal))

How many bits would you need in order to store the numbers between 0 and 3 inclusive?
Answer: we need 2 bits (11(binary) = 3(decimal))

How many bits would you need in order to store the numbers between 0 and 1000 inclusive?
Answer: we need 10 bits (1111101000(binary) = 1000(decimal))

How can you test if a binary number is a power of two (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...)?
Answer: A binary number is a power of two if it has only one '1' bit.
