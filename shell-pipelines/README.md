# Shell pipelines exercises

This folder contains exercises to help you practice combining shell tools in pipelines.

Each folder is named after a group of tools, and contains exercises to practice using them.

You are not expected to use tools that weren't in the folder names to solve the problems, but you are allowed to if you want to!

Each folder contains a number of scripts named `script-??.sh` as well as some files that are used by the scripts. You should look in the scripts one at a time and understand what you need to fix.

When a script is complete, move on to the next script.

When a folder is complete, move on to the next folder.

Before running a script you should `cd` into the directory it's in.
You should write all of your scripts assuming they're running inside the directory they're saved in.

You can approach the folders in any order.
