# This code contains bugs related to types. They are bugs mypy can catch.

# Read this code to understand what it’s trying to do. Add type annotations to the method parameters and return types of this code. Run the code through mypy, and fix all of the bugs that show up. When you’re confident all of the type annotations are correct, and the bugs are fixed, run the code and check it works.

#To fix these errors, In the open_account function I need to ensure that the balances parameter is a dictionary mapping strings to integers, the name parameter is a string, and the amount parameter is an integer .
#Additionally, I need to make sure that the values passed to the open_account function are of the correct types.
#Here is the corrected code with type annotations and fixed function calls:
