Doctor: Hello
Patient: Hello Doctor
Doctor: What's wrong today?
Patient: Hello, I can't stop saying hello
Doctor: That sounds frustrating. When did this start?
Patient: Hello, about two days ago.
Doctor: Say "Hi".
Patient: Hi
Doctor: You didn't say hello
Patient: I seem to be cured!
Doctor: You're welcome, goodbye

Patient: I went to the doctor!
Spouse: I'm glad you saw the Doctor: did they cure you?
Patient: Yes!
