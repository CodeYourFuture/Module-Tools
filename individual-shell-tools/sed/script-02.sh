# TODO: Write a command to output input.txt with numbers removed.
# The output should contain 11 lines.
# Line 6 of the output should be " Alisha".

sed 's/[0-9]*//g' input.txt # however Alisha is not on the 6 line 

This is a sample file for experimenting with sed.

It contains many lines, and there are some things you may want to do with each of them.       

We'll include some score information:
 Alisha
 Jacob
 Pietro
 Katya

We also should remember, when we go shopping, to get  items: oranges,cheese,bread,olives.
